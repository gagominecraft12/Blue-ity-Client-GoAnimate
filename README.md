# Frequently Asked Questions

<p>How do i have to import assets?</p>

<li>Yeah. You need to install Visual Studio Code and download the extension <strong>GIT</strong> and restart. Now make a folder and place the Wrapper Online Assets which is called <a href="https://github.com/2Epik4u/wrapper-online-assets"> and you should go to _THEMES folder. Now click in `custom.xml` file. Now to to some line that says `Line 2974` And now copy the selected thing. OH WAIT. Also go to config.json file. If did you not find it will be in `ALPHABET` Order. Now change this with https://wrapperonlineold.2epik4u.xyz/` Which says but you need to go to settings "AT GITHUB. NOT VISUAL STUDIO CODE OR NOTEPAD." Go to "Github Pages" tab and it says that you need to "Enable GitHub Pages" button. Now you have it. Go to your website that says <a href="https://YOUROWNUSERNAME.github.io/REPONAME/"> or <a href="https://YOURREPONAME.github.io/"> <strong>Atleast not asking to import voice clips before i fix the voiceclips and betterize the starters</strong</li>

<li>Yeah. You need Visual Studio Code and Install `GIT` and Clone this repository. and it says `Code`. And click in the copy button. Now paste this in `GIT Source Control` Tab.</li>
